# PrimaryAccess Project

PrimaryAccess is a suite of free online tools that allows students and teachers to use primary source documents to complete meaningful and compelling learning activities with digital movies.

PrimaryAccess enables you to combine text, audio and images into compelling personal narratives and digital stories, with a simple movie-making process. Steps like scripting, recording and saving are entirely Web-based--no software to install--and the movies are easy to retrieve and share.

PrimaryAccess is freely avalable for educational use by the University of Virginia's Sciences, Humanities and Arts Network of Technological Initiatives (SHANTI).
